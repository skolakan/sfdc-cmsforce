#Open list of features to be added.

# Introduction #

Below is a list of features that could be added to CMSForce.


- Page versioning, staging and approval
- Better integration with sharing rules ('with sharing' needs to be added in a lot of places)
- Page categories (tags ?)
- Sites 'Folders' to allow for better manageability when the number of pages grow
- Support for multiple, site-dependant 'Home Pages' (an org can have up to 25 Sites defined).
- A fully custom UI (I need to draw a wireframe to make this clear)
- In-page editing when logged in (a hovering toolbar over each content area with 'edit', 'delete', 'sort order', etc... functionality)
- Site Search functionality
- FckEditor support for styles defined in the site (don't know if this is even possible)
- A revamp of the Web Form editor UI
- Support for attachments in Web Forms
- Support for a 'confirmation page' with filled in info in web forms before final submit
